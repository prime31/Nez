	/// <summary>Rectangle packer using an algorithm by Javier Arevalo</summary>
	/// <remarks>
	///   <para>
	///     Original code by Javier Arevalo (jare at iguanademos dot com). Rewritten
	///     to C# / .NET by Markus Ewald (cygon at nuclex dot org). The following comments
	///     were written by the original author when he published his algorithm.
	///   </para>
	///   <para>
	///     You have a bunch of rectangular pieces. You need to arrange them in a
	///     rectangular surface so that they don't overlap, keeping the total area of the
	///     rectangle as small as possible. This is fairly common when arranging characters
	///     in a bitmapped font, lightmaps for a 3D engine, and I guess other situations as
	///     well.
	///   </para>
	///   <para>
	///     The idea of this algorithm is that, as we add rectangles, we can pre-select
	///     "interesting" places where we can try to add the next rectangles. For optimal
	///     results, the rectangles should be added in order. I initially tried using area
	///     as a sorting criteria, but it didn't work well with very tall or very flat
	///     rectangles. I then tried using the longest dimension as a selector, and it
	///     worked much better. So much for intuition...
	///   </para>
	///   <para>
	///     These "interesting" places are just to the right and just below the currently
	///     added rectangle. The first rectangle, obviously, goes at the top left, the next
	///     one would go either to the right or below this one, and so on. It is a weird way
	///     to do it, but it seems to work very nicely.
	///   </para>
	///   <para>
	///     The way we search here is fairly brute-force, the fact being that for most
	///     offline purposes the performance seems more than adequate. I have generated a
	///     japanese font with around 8500 characters and all the time was spent generating
	///     the bitmaps.
	///   </para>
	///   <para>
	///     Also, for all we care, we could grow the parent rectangle in a different way
	///     than power of two. It just happens that power of 2 is very convenient for
	///     graphics hardware textures.
	///   </para>
	///   <para>
	///     I'd be interested in hearing of other approaches to this problem. Make sure
	///     to post them on http://www.flipcode.com
