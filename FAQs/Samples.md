Samples
==========

The [Nez Samples repository](https://github.com/prime31/Nez-Samples) consists of a bunch of bite-sized samples detailing how to work with the various subsystems available in Nez. In order to get them running happily you need to do the following:

- clone the repo and ensure the subrepository is also updated (the main Nez repo is added as submodule)
- open Nez/Nez.sln and build that first. This is required so that the NuGet packages are downloaded.
- now you can open the main solution and run any of the projects in there
